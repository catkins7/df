player summary improvements (number of matches, win %, right tray with more statistics?, hero win rates, players you play with the most, etc)
	match result graph? (goes up one pixel for a win, down one for a loss?  shows last ~50 games or so?)

fetch all for player feature
when fetching match history for random players (who you didn't "fetch all" for), only actually add the latest 10 or 20 matches (For speed!)
