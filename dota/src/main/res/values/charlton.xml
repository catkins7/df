        Probably my favorite Heston movie is <i>Planet of the Apes</i>.  Basically any time Heston is talking during the movie, its pure gold.  The movie begins with an awesome monologue and ends with a great revelation at the end.  The sequels are good as well, but its a different kind of good, and Heston is only in the 2nd one for a little (but amazing) bit.
