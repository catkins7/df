0.4.2 Tabs / Holo release
---------------------------
split stats into a couple different tabs

backing out all the way of the app, and then going back in, shows loading screen for an instant with a flicker; see if we can fix the flicker?

code walkthrough / cleanup all files quick

make sure we aren't hardcoding strings all over, unless just for test/debug

bundle all dagons/difussal blades into the same item for stats calculation?

test layouts on a couple different emulators 

memory crash tests

test fresh install

some real charlton photos, randomly selected between them!

updates screen shots in play store



0.4.+ More Stats release
---------------------------
-More Stats!
 - most/least successful heroes!  highest win percentage, but only consider heroes that have been played more than 1% of games?
 - records (most kills, deaths, etc) with link to the match
 - graphs (kda, win/lost graph, etc)

Issue leaving memory and drawer is still on the right, but empty?   CharltonACtivity not getting destroyed when the app leaves memory??
 - first, comment out the hack fix in onResume of the LoadingFragment
 - to reproduce, start the app, stay on the starred user list, clear memory, and return to the app.  You should be able to use the right/left menus now!
 - check memory, maybe we are creating duplicates of the app somehow, and the wrong one is being setup the second time?




0.5 release
---------------------------
match summary improvements?
	- delay clicking into match details?  probably because its a pretty heavy layout.  Maybe switch more to list view somehow?
	- "Item of the match", similar to the hero/item favorite calculations
	- general UI improvements and polish for that page




0.6 release
---------------------------
Flesh out the charlton feature




TODO OTHER
---------------------------
refresh steam user from server if cell is made and it doesn't have the info?  (similar to the match view stuff?)

don't load player match lists until you go into the player summary page?




Features Backlog
---------------------------
match summary improvements (so it doesn't look so meh, right tray with more statistics?  Item of the game? (the item with the most money spent on it))
