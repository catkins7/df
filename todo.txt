 0.4.+ Even More Stats Release
---------------------------
Match fetcher progress bar gets off

add ability info to the Match details --> only write down the four ability IDs, don't save all the AbilityUpgrade data with the disk adapter (way too slow...)
 - only store for ability draft games?
 - and to the disk parser
 - update other player disk stuff so it all is disk adapters
 - check other adapters and make disk versions to help with speed while were at it maybe? (for match and player and additionalUnit)

ALL MATCHES data wipe, so we have all the ability match data going forward (should be able to keep the match id list on the user though?)

switch to non-beta package name?

-More Stats!
 -records (most kills, deaths, etc) with link to the match
 -friends tab; lists a user's steam friends.  Also shows people you have played many matches with?   show win percentages for each??

swipe between tabs??  would be really nice...

about page?  access from menu?




0.5 release
---------------------------
match summary improvements?
 - delay clicking into match details?  probably because its a pretty heavy layout.  Maybe switch more to list view somehow?
 - "Item of the match", similar to the hero/item favorite calculations
 - player of the game??
 - general UI improvements and polish for that page
 - add lobby type (co-op vs bots, etc) to the details

show player abilities for each match, in the order they trained them, on the bottom of each player row?
 - would need to figure out abilityIds and where to get the ability images... might not be worth it for now




0.6 release
---------------------------
Flesh out the charlton feature
 - more pictures?




1.0 release
---------------------------




TODO OTHER
---------------------------
refresh steam user from server if cell is made and it doesn't have the info?  (similar to the match view stuff?)




Features Backlog
---------------------------
pro match upcoming ticker:  http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1u86ht/free_matchticker_api_the_one_rdota2_also_uses_now/

pro players list?  pro teams?  for easy access to pro player profiles.  maybe another tab on starred users activity

Premium version of the app, after play store general release?  would be a paid version ($4?) that has additional features 
 - graphs (kda, win/lost graph, etc)   (Trends Tab?)
 - it looks like K+A/D might be indicator or skill.  or  K+A/D / TeamScore.  It might be worth plotting some of these values in a spreadsheet and seeing

ability draft abilities for heroes?  need to get abilityID values from somewhere




Someday
---------------------------
bundle all dagons/difussal/necronomicon into the same item for stats calculation?
