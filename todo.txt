0.4 release
---------------------------

STATS todo:
- win % for all match summaries

More Stats!
 - favorite game mode?
 - records (most kills, deaths, etc)
 - graphs (kda, win/lost graph, etc)



warning message at the top if there is not very much data (< 100 games?)



look over all classes for quick clean-ups

weird case where the right drawer won't open anymore?
	- related to issue with the drawerFragment not getting unset when the side menu has gone

menu, info option; shows dialog with explanation of CSScore and other potentially confusing values

need to be able to open right drawer anytime by swiping from the right edge

make sure we are only using games that have a result for stats calculation

handle stats drawer case with no matches better

fix issue with steam users re-ordering after update, because updated steam name is never saved




0.5 release
---------------------------
match summary improvements?
	- delay clicking into match details?  probably because its a pretty heavy layout.  Maybe switch more to list view somehow?
	- "Item of the match", similar to the hero/item favorite calculations
	- general UI improvements and polish for that page




0.6 release
---------------------------
Charlton talking feature





TODO OTHER
---------------------------
refresh steam user from server if cell is made and it doesn't have the info?  (similar to the match view stuff?)

don't load player match lists until you go into the player summary page?




Features Backlog
