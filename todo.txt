0.6.0 README
---------------------------




TODO OTHER
---------------------------
google analytics, so I can see what people really like to use

optimizations on statistics calculation, so it doesn't calculate everything if it doesn't need it?

refresh steam user from server if cell is made and it doesn't have the info?  (similar to the match view stuff?)
 -case in match summary when a steam user fetch call fails, and the name doesn't update ever if it succeeds later.




Features Backlog
---------------------------
-Update Match->matchId to be a Long.  
	-Update everywhere to use matchId as a Long instead of a String.
	-Update the disk loaders.  
	-This will help match sorting performance hugely.

-rating prompt?  after the user has opened the app 25 times or so?

-Add extra match summary page, with all the other player info im not showing now.  
	-Take a polish sweep on the match summary page?  

-leagues???!!!

spinner for network activity?

rework stats tab(s) to have a modes dropdown (recent, ranked, public, other?)

dialog on startup, or at some point that tells the user the valve api isn't working right now?

player RECORDS? (most kills, deaths, etc) with link to the match

compare stats with a friend's side by side?

steam friend's list?
 -https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API

pro match upcoming ticker:  http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1u86ht/free_matchticker_api_the_one_rdota2_also_uses_now/

pro players list?  pro teams?  for easy access to pro player profiles.  maybe another tab on starred users activity

Premium version of the app, after play store general release?  would be a paid version ($4?) that has additional features 
 - graphs (kda, win/lost graph, etc)   (Trends Tab?)
 - it looks like K+A/D might be indicator or skill.  or  K+A/D / TeamScore.  It might be worth plotting some of these values in a spreadsheet and seeing

 -Joe's account, vs elder titan, date is wrong
   --> Match id 230456632
   --> Looks like it was data issue from old old matches saved in previous formats.  Fixed now, so probalby not worth fixing.




Someday
---------------------------
bundle all dagons/difussal/necronomicon into the same item for stats calculation?




Q&A thoughts:
 -accurate items.txt  (item costs often wrong (diffusal 2, dagon, necronomicon, many recipe costs incorrect, etc)
 -500 match fetch limit
 -fetch more than one match details
 -player search (sucks right now, most apps are just scraping dotabuff's search page)
 -ability icon image endpoints not really documented, ability.json?  neutral abilities not online?
 -items.txt endpoint
