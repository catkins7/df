0.5 release
---------------------------
match summary improvements?
 - delay clicking into match details?  probably because its a pretty heavy layout.  Maybe switch more to list view somehow?
 - "Item of the match", similar to the hero/item favorite calculations
 - player of the game??
 - general UI improvements and polish for that page
 - add lobby type (co-op vs bots, etc) to the details

Flesh out the charlton feature?

 - it looks like K+A/D might be indicator or skill.  or  K+A/D / TeamScore.  It might be worth plotting some of these values in a spreadsheet and seeing

google analytics, so I can see what people really like to use
