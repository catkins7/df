player summary improvements (number of matches, win %, right tray with more statistics?, hero win rates, players you play with the most, etc)
	match result graph? (public, matchmaking) (goes up one pixel for a win, down one for a loss?  shows last ~50 games or so?)
	kds graph?
	favorite item??  (item the most money is spent on)
	CS Score?  the average gpm, or average CS of all players in your games (that didn't have leavers, and more than 5 minutes?).  
		-Might be good indication of player skill rating

don't load player match lists until you go into the player summary page?
