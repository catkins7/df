TODO OTHER
---------------------------
refresh steam user from server if cell is made and it doesn't have the info?  (similar to the match view stuff?)
 -case in match summary when a steam user fetch call fails, and the name doesn't update ever if it succeeds later.




Features Backlog
---------------------------
-leagues???!!!

spinner for network activity?

re-order player stats tabs as suggested by joe?

rework stats tab(s) to have a modes dropdown (recent, ranked, public, other?)

dialog on startup, or at some point that tells the user the valve api isn't working right now?

Recent tab, showing all games from the last 3-7 days?  Last week maybe?  not divided by public or anything like that

player RECORDS? (most kills, deaths, etc) with link to the match

compare stats with a friend's side by side?

matchups?  Players win rate vs different heroes on the enemy team

steam friend's list?

pro match upcoming ticker:  http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1u86ht/free_matchticker_api_the_one_rdota2_also_uses_now/

pro players list?  pro teams?  for easy access to pro player profiles.  maybe another tab on starred users activity

Premium version of the app, after play store general release?  would be a paid version ($4?) that has additional features 
 - graphs (kda, win/lost graph, etc)   (Trends Tab?)
 - it looks like K+A/D might be indicator or skill.  or  K+A/D / TeamScore.  It might be worth plotting some of these values in a spreadsheet and seeing

google analytics, so I can see what people really like to use




Someday
---------------------------
bundle all dagons/difussal/necronomicon into the same item for stats calculation?

Q&A thoughts:
 -accurate items.txt  (item costs often wrong (diffusal 2, dagon, necronomicon, many recipe costs incorrect, etc)
 -500 match fetch limit
 -fetch more than one match details
 -player search (sucks right now, most apps are just scraping dotabuff's search page)
 -ability icon image endpoints not really documented, ability.json?  neutral abilities not online?
 -items.txt endpoint
