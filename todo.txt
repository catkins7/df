Issue leaving memory and drawer is still on the right, but empty?   CharltonACtivity not getting destroyed when the app leaves memory??
 - first, comment out the hack fix in onResume of the LoadingFragment
 - to reproduce, start the app, stay on the starred user list, clear memory, and return to the app.  You should be able to use the right/left menus now!
 - check memory, maybe we are creating duplicates of the app somehow, and the wrong one is being setup the second time?
