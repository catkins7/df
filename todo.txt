0.4 release
---------------------------

STATS overview:
 - Ranked Stats Summary (all ranked games, game count, win %, k/d/a averages, average game length)
 - Unranked Stats Summary (same, but for unranked)
 - CSScore, GoldScore, whatever I decide is more valuable, for last 120 ranked games with the top 10, bot 10 outliers chopped off
 - Favorite Heroes (all games)
 - Favorite Items (all games)

warning message at the top if there is not very much data (< 100 games?)



look over all classes for quick clean-ups

weird case where the right drawer won't open anymore?
	- related to issue with the drawerFragment not getting unset when the side menu has gone

menu, info option; shows dialog with explanation of CSScore and other potentially confusing values

need to be able to open right drawer anytime by swiping from the right edge

ONLY CALCULATE THE LAST 100 [RANKED] GAMES FOR CSScore/GoldScore/XPScore?  Otherwise if their skill has changed it wouldn't be reflected?
take some sample points and come up with a way to estimate ranked ELO?



make sure we are only using games that have a result for stats calculation


More Stats!
 - favorite game mode?
 - records (most kills, deaths, etc)
 - graphs (kda, win/lost graph, etc)





player summary improvements (number of matches, win %, right tray with more statistics?, hero win rates, players you play with the most, etc)
	match result graph? (public, matchmaking) (goes up one pixel for a win, down one for a loss?  shows last ~50 games or so?)
	kda graph?
	CS Score?  the average gpm, or average CS of all players in your games (that didn't have leavers, and more than 5 minutes?).  
		-Might be good indication of player skill rating

handle stats drawer case with no matches better

fix issue with steam users re-ordering after update, because updated steam name is never saved




0.5 release
---------------------------
match summary improvements?
	- delay clicking into match details?  probably because its a pretty heavy layout.  Maybe switch more to list view somehow?
	- "Item of the match", similar to the hero/item favorite calculations
	- general UI improvements and polish for that page




0.6 release
---------------------------
Charlton talking feature





TODO OTHER
---------------------------
refresh steam user from server if cell is made and it doesn't have the info?  (similar to the match view stuff?)

don't load player match lists until you go into the player summary page?




Features Backlog
---------------------------
match summary improvements (so it doesn't look so meh, right tray with more statistics?  Item of the game? (the item with the most money spent on it))
	- add lobby type (co-op vs bots, etc) to the details


left menu feature
 - starred players
 - pro players list?  pro teams?  for easy access to pro player profiles
 - about page?
 - click charles to open the menu, or just drag from the left?
