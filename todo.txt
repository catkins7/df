0.4 release
---------------------------

joke for mike, all heroes favorite items:  bloodstone, battlefury, basic wand

look over all classes for quick clean-ups

player summary improvements (number of matches, win %, right tray with more statistics?, hero win rates, players you play with the most, etc)
	match result graph? (public, matchmaking) (goes up one pixel for a win, down one for a loss?  shows last ~50 games or so?)
	kda graph?
	win rates for favorite heroes and items?
	CS Score?  the average gpm, or average CS of all players in your games (that didn't have leavers, and more than 5 minutes?).  
		-Might be good indication of player skill rating

handle stats drawer case with no matches better

weird case where the right drawer won't open anymore?




0.5 release
---------------------------
match summary improvements?
	- delay clicking into match details?  probably because its a pretty heavy layout.  Maybe switch more to list view somehow?

	- general UI improvements and polish for that page




0.6 release
---------------------------
Charlton talking feature





TODO OTHER
---------------------------
refresh steam user from server if cell is made and it doesn't have the info?  (similar to the match view stuff?)

don't load player match lists until you go into the player summary page?
