0.4 release
---------------------------

look over all classes for quick clean-ups

menu, info option; shows dialog with explanation of CSScore and other potentially confusing values

need to be able to open right drawer anytime by swiping from the right edge

ONLY CALCULATE THE LAST 100 [RANKED] GAMES FOR CSScore/GoldScore/XPScore?  Otherwise if their skill has changed it wouldn't be reflected?
take some sample points and come up with a way to estimate ranked ELO?


KDA Average
CSScore  (average total CS per game, chop off top/bot 10%?)   
GoldScore (average GPM per game, chop off top/bot 10%?)
average game length

warning message at the top if there is not very much data (< 100 games?)

make sure we are only using games that have a result for stats calculation




player summary improvements (number of matches, win %, right tray with more statistics?, hero win rates, players you play with the most, etc)
	match result graph? (public, matchmaking) (goes up one pixel for a win, down one for a loss?  shows last ~50 games or so?)
	kda graph?
	CS Score?  the average gpm, or average CS of all players in your games (that didn't have leavers, and more than 5 minutes?).  
		-Might be good indication of player skill rating

handle stats drawer case with no matches better

weird case where the right drawer won't open anymore?




0.5 release
---------------------------
match summary improvements?
	- delay clicking into match details?  probably because its a pretty heavy layout.  Maybe switch more to list view somehow?
	- "Item of the match", similar to the hero/item favorite calculations
	- general UI improvements and polish for that page




0.6 release
---------------------------
Charlton talking feature





TODO OTHER
---------------------------
refresh steam user from server if cell is made and it doesn't have the info?  (similar to the match view stuff?)

don't load player match lists until you go into the player summary page?




Features Backlog
---------------------------
match summary improvements (so it doesn't look so meh, right tray with more statistics?  Item of the game? (the item with the most money spent on it))
	- add lobby type (co-op vs bots, etc) to the details


left menu feature
 - starred players
 - pro players list?  pro teams?  for easy access to pro player profiles
