        This basic app will be available free, always.  It may become ad supported at some point in the future, but I have no plans for that at this time.  I made this app for myself, my friends, and for the Dota 2 community as a whole.  I want everyone to use it!

        You may be wondering why Charlton Heston is sprinkled throughout the app.  No, it is not a joke.  Many people only remember him for his gun rights advocacy in his later years, which is a shame because he was in some really great movies.  If putting Charles in this app gets just one person to watch <i>Ben-Hur</i> or <i>Planet of the Apes</i>, then I think it is worth it.
