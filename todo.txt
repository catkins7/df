 0.4.+ Even More Stats Release
---------------------------
-More Stats!
 -records (most kills, deaths, etc) with link to the match
 -friends tab; lists a user's steam friends.  Also shows people you have played many matches with?   show win percentages for each??

about page?  access from menu?




0.5 release
---------------------------
match summary improvements?
 - delay clicking into match details?  probably because its a pretty heavy layout.  Maybe switch more to list view somehow?
 - "Item of the match", similar to the hero/item favorite calculations
 - general UI improvements and polish for that page
 - add lobby type (co-op vs bots, etc) to the details




0.6 release
---------------------------
Flesh out the charlton feature




TODO OTHER
---------------------------
refresh steam user from server if cell is made and it doesn't have the info?  (similar to the match view stuff?)




Features Backlog
---------------------------
pro players list?  pro teams?  for easy access to pro player profiles.  maybe another tab on starred users activity

Premium version of the app, after play store general release?  would be a paid version ($4?) that has additional features 
 - graphs (kda, win/lost graph, etc)   (Trends Tab?)
 - it looks like K+A/D might be indicator or skill.  or  K+A/D / TeamScore.  It might be worth plotting some of these values in a spreadsheet and seeing




Someday
---------------------------
bundle all dagons/difussal/necronomicon into the same item for stats calculation?
