0.5 release
---------------------------
match summary improvements?
 - switch to a simple list with the 5 stats on the top, like on the statistics page?  doesn't look that great right now
 - part of the player rows list view, so they scroll with the players.  Only non-scrollable part is the 40-23 DIRE VICTORY row

3 different player row views, normal, normal+bear, normal+abilities (lone druid not in ability draft)

Flesh out the charlton feature?
 -add "about charlton" dialog when you tap on his text bubble.  write some text about why I like charlton heston and some of his major accomplishments.  Add wikipedia link, and movie recommendations.
 -or just more pictures?

final look at overdraw!

test on different screen size emulators

check lint errors
memory checks on all fragments

ability draft abilities for heroes?  need to get abilityID values from somewhere
 -get abilities.json and start showing abilities??

go thorugh all drawable resources and delete unused stuff

double loading screen issue??

email gaben/zoid about possibility of meet-up at ti4?
 -accurate items.txt  (item costs often wrong (diffusal 2, dagon, necronomicon, many recipe costs incorrect, etc)
 -500 match fetch limit
 -fetch more than one match details
 -player search (sucks right now, most apps are just scraping dotabuff's search page)
 -ability icon image endpoints
 -items.txt endpoint




0.6 Play store release
---------------------------
- update all app images so they are recent
- update items.txt with latest dota2 build




TODO OTHER
---------------------------
update to okhttp 2.0.0 once retrofit supports it
- and update picasso as well

refresh steam user from server if cell is made and it doesn't have the info?  (similar to the match view stuff?)




Features Backlog
---------------------------
player RECORDS? (most kills, deaths, etc) with link to the match

steam friend's list?
 -https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API

pro match upcoming ticker:  http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1u86ht/free_matchticker_api_the_one_rdota2_also_uses_now/

pro players list?  pro teams?  for easy access to pro player profiles.  maybe another tab on starred users activity

Premium version of the app, after play store general release?  would be a paid version ($4?) that has additional features 
 - graphs (kda, win/lost graph, etc)   (Trends Tab?)
 - it looks like K+A/D might be indicator or skill.  or  K+A/D / TeamScore.  It might be worth plotting some of these values in a spreadsheet and seeing

google analytics, so I can see what people really like to use





Someday
---------------------------
bundle all dagons/difussal/necronomicon into the same item for stats calculation?
